# Release Process

> There are certain parts about the process that could be automated better, pull requests are welcome.

1. Pick a new version number according to [semver](https://semver.org/). Note that we consider the commands and output part of unipipe-cli's "API".
  
2. Update the version number in these places:

    - `main.ts`

3. Update `CHANGELOG.md`. We follow the guidelines from
   [Keep a Changelog][keep-a-changelog]. It's recommended to add changes for the next version in a vNext section already together with pull requests, as this will make releasing a lot easier.

4. Commit changes. Use the convention UniPipe CLI vX.X.X” in your commit message.
   There shouldn’t be any other code changes.

5. Tag the commit with the version number `git tag v.X.X.X`

6. Push the release tag `git push origin --tags`

7. CI will run the [release workflow](../unipipe-cli/.github/workflows/release.yml) and create a new [GitHub Release](github-release).

8. Manually edit the release on GitHub and paste the entries from `CHANGELOG.md` into the release description.
